Added forms needed to do login / register
Added form to create event (combined ticket creator as I could not find a way to do buttons that add another form (let me know if this needs to be investigated further))
Did not yet create forms for booking tickets as I was unsure if I needed to implement it with variable placeholders given that events can have a number of ticket types in the original website designs, please let me know how you would like to address/change this

Let me know what work you want me to tackle next
